Example: Branded domain is going for target keyword "dog training"
```sh
GOOD: http://www.ilovemyk9.com/dog-training
BAD: http://www.ilovemyk9.com/dog-training-guide-for-new-owners-of-puppies
```
Example: Partial match domain is going for target keyword "puppy training"
```sh
GOOD: http://www.dogguides.com/puppy-training (bonus because “dog’ is related to the word puppy)
BAD: http://www.dogguides.com/guide-for-training-your-puppy-dog (too long and "dog" is used twice)
```
2. Get your keyword in the Title (once), keep the string together for the most part, and keep it at the front of
the title tag.
Recent tests have shown that shorter title tags are out-performing longer versions. Avoid adding “click
bait” words until you’re ranked #1-#5 when it really starts to matter.
